# BasicFront

This is a simple front app with 2 forms (1 template, 1 reactive). The purpose of this app is to test a browser.
There is currently 3 http methods used (get, post, delete).
The distant API is https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/, a fake API for testing.

Next : add some color and maybe rework css using Bootstrap
